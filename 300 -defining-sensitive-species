== Defining sensitive species

Without a good understanding of the potential threats to a species, one
of the first hurdles for a data publisher is making a decision on which
data should be considered sensitive and thus generalized. The question
is: will publishing those data on that species at a specific moment in
time increase the risk to that species from targeted exploitation? In
this section we explore the landscape of frameworks that exist between a
number of data publishers and GBIF nodes for the identification and
generalization of sensitive species data.
