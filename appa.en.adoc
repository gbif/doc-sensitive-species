== Conceptual framework for defining sensitive species

.Conceptual framework of the main elements that have been used to define sensitive species, based on ChapmanÂ´s data generalization guidelines, complemented with additional elements found in the literature. The table includes examples of the approach developed by some organizations and initiatives. The specific elements proposed by Chapman to define sensitivity are in *_bold italics_* and include both biological and non-biological aspects. This compilation represents a contribution to facilitate the development of protocols to manage sensitive species data, particularly for data generators, aggregators and repositories.

|Elements |Description of the elements used to identify sensitive data

2+|A. *Sensitive species*: identification of sensitive species

|_Risk of harm_ 
|- Risk of harm is a result of the *_use_* of the targeted species, e.g. if the species is *hunted, killed, disturbed, exploited, collected (individuals, seed, eggs), harvested, poached, traded*. Also related to the *interest* that the species invokes in humans (e.g., birdwatching) or a *perceived threat to humans* out of fear (e.g., spiders), or danger (e.g., bats, snakes) or as pests (e.g., badgers). +
- Harm to the species is always *intentional* and not accidental or ascollateral damage of an activity in which the species is not targeted. +
- Risk of harm can be from both legal *and illegal activities*. +
- Risk of harm may be considered for species with *phylogenetic proximity* to a currently targeted species. +
- Risk of harm is higher for those species of *higher economic,cultural* or *medicinal value* +
- Risk of harm is higher for *rare, uncommon* and/or *endemic*, as these may invoke specific interest +
 +
_Examples in use_: GBIF; NBN (UK), ALA (Australia), NSSL (South Africa), INPH-SINP (France), ERIN (Australia), IUCN, SLU (Sweden), Laji.Fi (Finland), eBird

|_Evaluating the impact of harm_
|- *Intensity of the activity*: Does the activity have lethal ornon-lethal effects on individuals? Are all individuals targeted and at all times of the year i.e. does the activity occur all year or only at specific times? Are there specific life stages (e.g., eggs, mature adults, juveniles) or sexes that are targeted that may affect the demographics of the populations? Is the activity increasing or decreasing? +
- *Ecology of the species*: To what extent will the species be able torecover/regenerate from targeted use or disturbance? Does the targeted population have a very restricted range that makes it more vulnerable to harmful activities? +
- *Novelty of the species*: Descriptions of new species can triggertrade and overexploitation of those
species. +
 +
_Examples in use_: GBIF, eBird, NSSL, ERIN, IUCN, SINP, DRYAD

|_Conservation status_
|- Species is *Critically Endangered*, *Endangered* or *Vulnerable* at a global, regional, national, or subnational level. +
 +
_Examples in use_: GBIF (criteria 4.2), ALA, NSSL, iNaturalist, IUCN, SLU, DRYAD

2+|B. *Sensitive data*: will the publication of the data increase potential harm to the taxon.

2+|B.1 _Species features_

|_Ability to detect and track the species_ (*detectability*)
|- *Mobility*: Species with low mobility (e.g., cactus, molluscs, sedentary species) may be more detectable if specific location data is informed. +
- *Abundance and density*: species found at low densities i.e. dispersed individuals over a wide area may be less likely to be found. Gregarious species with higher densities may be easier to detect when compared with solitary species. +
- *Accessibility*: some locations may be very remote or dangerous to reach, limiting access. +
- *Territoriality*: species with predictable displacements orphilopatry may make individuals easier to locate.

|_Time and location-specific factors_ 
|- Does the data provide information of *nesting/breeding sites* of the species? +
- Does the data provide evidence of a species during known periods when targeted exploitation is higher e.g. when in bloom , or when on targeted life stages e.g. eggs or seeds that may be harvested?

2+|B.2 _Data content and local context_

|Public availability of the data
|- *Novelty*: Is the data is already publicly available in scientific literature, news, social media, atlases, popular knowledge, legal or illegal sources, or findable using an internet search engine? If it's a novel location for the species, it may be considered more sensitive. +
- *spatial resolution*: higher levels of resolution / precision at which the data is published may increase risks +
 +
_Examples in use_: ERIN, SINP

|_Protection of the area_
|- Consider the *effective protection* of the area in which the record is located. +
 +
_Examples in use_: DRYAD, ERIN, https://doi.org/10.35035/vs84-0p13[Chapman 2006^].

|_Local legislation and conservation_ 
|- Consider the existence of *species-level legislation* that may locally protect the species against exploitation +
- Will *conservation efforts* be impacted or benefit from the data publication. +
- Consider any *local data publication protocols, guidelines or legislation* related to the publication of data related to the species.

|_Potential conflicts_ 
|- Consider land tenure, i.e if the record is located on *privately or community-managed lands* +
- Check legal and social norms related to *permissions to publish* data on that area

== Use of Darwin Core terms

.Examples of the texts used in the records reviewed in which the Darwin Core terms term:dwc[dataGeneralization] (DG) or term:dwc[dataWithheld] (WH) were used to describe data management due to the potential sensitivity of the species.
