=== Examples of sensitive species generalizations

==== Rhinoceroses

Species from the family Rhinocertidae are well-known to be a valuable target for poachers and hunters, so we used them as an example to explore the use of data generalizations on their GBIF-mediated occurrence records. We filtered GBIF occurrences for the family and kept only records with coordinates, excluding observations based on fossils, living specimens and material samples. The resulting DwC archive included data for six species (excluding extinct ones) (<<appd,Appendix 4>>, Table S3). Among those species (all with accepted species-rank scientific names), there were also 5 subspecies with accepted scientific names and two were included as synonyms In sum, the six living species presented 3,371 occurrences, from which we excluded 187 that were located in countries outside their natural distributions (the United States, the Russian Federation, Netherlands and France) and thus considered specimens from ex situ collections.

For the remaining 3,184 occurrences, 88.2 per cent were generalized using the WH term, most of them (2,265) using the WH term included explicit indications of sensitivity in the data e.g., “coordinate uncertainty increased to _x_ metres to protect the threatened taxon”. Only 273 occurrences made use of the DG term (9.4 per cent), but none of them referring to the sensitivity of the species, and only mentioning spatial generalizations (e.g., “record obtained as a central point of a grid with 15 minutes”, “randomly obfuscated between 5-25 km”). In 342 occurrences with no WH nor DG, the record informed UNC, ranging from 1 (12 records) to 12,000 mt (13 records), although most informing 250 metres of uncertainty (220 records). Overall, there were 82 records with no generalization informed (not using any of the selected terms: WH, DG, FT, DP, UNC), which were related to _Diceros bicornis_, _Ceratotherium simum_ and _Rhinoceros unicornis._

==== Orchids

Orchids are one of the largest families of flowering plants with nearly 30,000 species globally and commonly traded and are particularly vulnerable to over-harvest because many species have a limited range and/or occur at low densities (https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.12721[Hinsley et al. 2016^]; https://doi.org/10.1093/botlinnean/box083[Hinsley et al. 2018^]; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40529-018-0232-z[Fay 2018^]). All species are on CITES Appendix II.

We retrieved 16,647 occurrences of threatened orchid (CR, EN, or VU) species in GBIF using similar filters to those for rhinos (https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.yyw5pj[GBIF.org 1 December 2022^]). The records corresponded to 250 accepted species, and 7 synonyms species names. Of these occurrences, 3,678 (22 per cent) had used the term WH and 7,731 (46 per cent) had used the term DG. In contrast with rhinoceros records, the mention of sensitivity was found for 96.1 per cent of the records with DG and in 60.7 per cent of the WH. All the records that used the WH to signal sensitivity were published by iNaturalist, stating “coordinate uncertainty increased to _x_ metres to protect threatened taxon”. The Swiss National Biodiversity Data and Information Centres (InfoFlora) published the largest number of occurrences (7,352), using DG and the text “in order to respect the currently nationally agreed ethical framework while simultaneously sharing scientifically utilizable data for large scale studies''. Other terms were identified to inform sensitive data generalizations, such as term:dwc[occurrenceremarks] (23 records) and term:dwc[georeferenceRemarks] (2,114 records). In total, 5,250 (32 per cent) occurrences of threatened orchids were not generalized.

=== Data management conclusions

This analysis was a first attempt to assess the degree to which sensitive and potentially sensitive data is being managed across GBIF and this initial assessment shows a mixed landscape. Firstly, most occurrences that we identified as being sensitive or potentially sensitive were not generalized even when they were on national lists using WH and DG terms. While this percentage was higher for well recognized species such as rhinos and orchids, even here significant numbers of records were not adequately generalized. However, a far larger number of occurrences did include coordinate uncertainty values although these may be under adequate thresholds for effective generalization of data. Secondly, when data is generalized, different generalization protocols are applied by different publishers and this may be affected by the country within which the publisher is, with occurrences from some countries more generalized than others. Between publishers, there is a wide variety in the use of Darwin Core terms for identifying sensitivity at the occurrence-level with no fixed vocabulary for the terms and a wide range of different types of information within the fields. The use of occurrence-level indications of sensitivity should be considered at the same time as improved sensitivity metadata. Finally, when we have national sensitive species lists, data coming from publishers outside of the country are more generalized than those from within the country, minimizing the perceived threat of repatriated data with respect to sensitive species data.
