== Appendix A

Table S1.Conceptual framework of the main elements that have been used to define sensitive species, based on Chapman´s data generalization guidelines, complemented with additional elements found in the literature. The table includes examples of the approach developed by some organizations and initiatives. The specific elements proposed by Chapman to define sensitivity are in *_bold italics_* and include both biological and non-biological aspects. This compilation represents a contribution to facilitate the development of protocols to manage sensitive species data, particularly for data generators, aggregators and repositories.

2+|*Sensitive species: identification of sensitive species*

|Risk of harm 
|- Risk of harm is a result of the *_use_* of the targeted species, e.g. if the species is *_hunted, killed, disturbed, exploited, collected (individuals, seed, eggs), harvested, poached, traded_*. Also related to the *_interest_* that the species invokes in humans (e.g., birdwatching) or a *_perceived threat to humans_* out of fear (e.g., spiders), or danger (e.g., bats, snakes) or as pests (e.g., badgers). +
- Harm to the species is always *_intentional_* and not accidental or ascollateral damage of an activity in which the species is not targeted. +
- Risk of harm can be from both legal *_and illegal activities._* +
- Risk of harm may be considered for species with *_phylogenetic proximity_* to a currently targeted species. +
- Risk of harm is higher for those species of *_higher economic,cultural_* or *_medicinal value_* +
- Risk of harm is higher for *_rare, uncommon_* and/or *_endemic_*, as these may invoke specific interest +
+
_Examples in use_: GBIF; NBN (UK), ALA (Australia), NSSL (South Africa), INPH-SINP (France), ERIN (Australia), IUCN, SLU (Sweden), Laji.Fi (Finland), eBird

|Evaluating the impact of harm 
|- *_Intensity of the activity_*: Does the activity have lethal ornon-lethal effects on individuals? Are all individuals targeted and at all times of the year i.e. does the activity occur all year or only at specific times? Are there specific life stages (e.g., eggs, mature adults, juveniles) or sexes that are targeted that may affect the demographics of the populations? Is the activity increasing or decreasing? +
- *_Ecology of the species_*: To what extent will the species be able torecover/regenerate from targeted use or disturbance? Does the targeted population have a very restricted range that makes it more vulnerable to harmful activities? +
- *_Novelty of the species_*: Descriptions of new species can triggertrade and overexploitation of those
species. +
+
_Examples in use_: GBIF, eBird, NSSL, ERIN, IUCN, SINP, DRYAD

|Conservation status
|- Species is *Critically Endangered*, *Endangered* or *Vulnerable* at a global, regional, national, or subnational level.
+
_Examples in use_: GBIF (criteria 4.2), ALA, NSSL, iNaturalist, IUCN, SLU, DRYAD

____
*_mobility_* - species with low mobility (e.g., cactus, molluscs,
sedentary species) may be more detectable if specific location data is
informed.

*_abundance and density_* - species found at low densities i.e.
dispersed individuals over a wide area may be less likely to be found.
Gregarious species with higher densities may be easier to detect when
compared with solitary species.

*_accessibility_* – some locations may be very remote or dangerous to
reach, limiting access.
____

____
*_territoriality_* - species with predictable displacements or
